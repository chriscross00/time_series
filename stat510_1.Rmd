##1.1 Overview

* AR(1) model: $x_{t} = \delta + \phi_{1}x_{t-1} + w_{t}$
    + Same properties of linear regression


##1.2 Sample ACF and Properities of AR(1) Model

* Weakly stationary series requirements:
    1. Mean $E(x_{t})$ is same for all _t_
    2. Variance of $x_t$ is same for all _t_
    3. Corvariance and correlation between $x_t$ and $x_{t-h}$ is same for all _t_
* Autocorrelation function (ACF) = gives correlation between $x_t$ and $x_{t-h}$ for $h = 1, 2...n$
    + ACF = 
    $$\frac{Cov(x_t, x_{t-h})}{s(x_t)s(x_t)} = \frac{Cov(x_t, x_{t-h})}{Var(x_t)}$$
* Properties of AR(1) model:
    + Mean($\mu$) = $\frac{\delta}{1-\phi_1}$
    + Var($x_t$) = $\frac{\sigma^2_w}{1-\phi^2_1}$
    + Cor($\rho_h$) = $\phi^2_1$
